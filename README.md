## OperatorHub API Documentation

### Model-based Endpoints
Some endpoints designed to retrieve objects from OperatorHub (products, order, orderitems, customers, staff, vehicles, events, agencies, branches, organisations) have a more standardised interface. See the below link for more information.

### Function-oriented Endpoints
Other endpoints are more functionally oriented, such as booking and availability, and have differing interfaces. See the link below for their description
