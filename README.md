##The J6 API and Documentation

Some endpoints designed to retrieve objects from OperatorHub (products, order, orderitems, customers, staff, vehicles, events, agencies, branches, organisations) have a more standardised interface. See the below link for more information.
[Model-based Endpoint Guide](https://github.com/Junction6/API/blob/V1/Docs/api-guide.md)

Other endpoints are more functionally oriented, such as booking and availability, and have differing interfaces. See the link below for their description
